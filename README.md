### Hi there 👋

I' m a computer wizard that feels like a superhero who can build many things. I also like to create stuff with my hands (especially with wood). I like playing guitar, Magic the Gathering, and I recently fell into the mechanical keyboards hole.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fun open-source stuff
- 📫 How to reach me: Via the contact link on [my website](https://ludwigdn.dev/)
